# The Directory Layout used for the Zenodo Artifact

The `WARio-PLDI-2022-artifact` directory holds the **structure** of the Zenodo
PLDI 2022 artifact without the docker images and source code. It only holds the
directory structure and README files to keep track of them in the Git repository.

For the full artifact, check the corresponding Zenodo archive.
